# mturk
- This repository contains codes for two online experiments (Amazon Mechanical Turk) to test human participant's irrelevant feature memory.
- See [here](http://www.hongsup.com/blog/2015/6/28/surprise) for more details.
- Both experiments were designed by using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
- In the actual mturk experiments, more trials were used.

## Experiment 1: Change localization to test one's irrelevant color
### Procedure
- A participants see a brief display of 4 colored oriented ellipses.
- After a delay, another brief display appears. One of the ellipses has changed its color. Another randomly chosen ellipse has changed its orientation.
- For the first 5 trials, participatns are asked to find the location of <b>orientation</b> change.
- In the 6th trial, participatns are asked to find the location of <b>color</b> change.

## Experiment 2: Delayed estimation to test one's irrelevant color
### Procedure
- A participants see a brief display of a colored oriented ellipse, followed by a delay.
- For the first 5 trials, participatns are asked to recall the <b>orientation</b> of the ellipse.
- In the 6th trial, participatns are asked to recall the <b>color</b> change.
